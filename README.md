- ⚡ Fun fact: Note really a fun fact, but - I ♥️ all things design. Interior, fine arts, garden, painting, graphics, motion, etc. I guess one weird fun fact would be that I drove a fork lift for nine years in the nineties for two different injection molding factories. This was all my pre-design era - during my fine arts hobby era.
