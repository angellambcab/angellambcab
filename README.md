## Hi there, welcome to my page 👋

**angellambcab/angellambcab** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
<p>
I am currently enrolled in the undergraduate/graduate program at Arizona State University for User Experience Design. With nearly two decades of combined experience in interior and graphic design, I have a deep passion for creating functional, aesthetically pleasing experiences. After graduation, I plan to apply my skills to my current role as the Creative Marketing Director for an ambulance, medical transport company, and clinical education center, enhancing branding, communication, and user interactions.
</p>
<p>Looking ahead, as I approach retirement, I aspire to teach UX and graphic design at a local level, sharing my knowledge with the next generation of designers. I also plan to stay actively involved in the local arts scene, fostering creativity in my community.
</p>
<p>
Outside of work and school, I enjoy gardening, spending time with my family (including my beloved fur kids), and indulging in a mix of multi-genre music, movies, and true crime podcasts.
</p>
<p>
I’m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute—whether through design, education, or creative expression.

  <li>⚡ Fun fact: Not really a fun fact, but - I ♥️ all things design. Interior, fine arts, garden, painting, graphics, motion, etc. I guess one weird fun fact would be that I drove a fork lift for nine years in the nineties for two different injection molding factories. This was all my pre-design era - during my fine arts hobby era.</li>
